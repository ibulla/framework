### [a barebones framework created to manage ibulla.com.](https://ibulla.com/)
The primary concept behind this repository is to create a straightforward and practical framework for showcasing my art, works, and portfolio. As an artist, the portfolio is a pivotal aspect of my creative journey. It serves a dual purpose – to catalog my work efficiently and to present it in an elegant and user-friendly manner.

A common theme that permeates my creative process is the notion of archiving. I'm continually preoccupied with questions surrounding the documentation, storage, and organization of my artistic endeavors.

That's where this project begins – with a desire for simplicity and effectiveness.

_That sets the stage for the journey._

Instead of meticulously adhering to conventional practices and guidelines, I chose a different path. I enlisted the assistance of my trusty companion, Chat GPT – a brilliant yet occasionally befuddled AI. The process was a collaborative one. I provided prompts, striving to remain as faithful as possible to the responses generated.

One of the foremost challenges encountered was the AI's fleeting memory. As the architectural scope expanded, responses tended to grow more abstract. However, for practical code implementation, tasks needed to be granular and meticulously defined. This dichotomy between big-picture thinking and fine-grained details proved a significant hurdle.

The result? It's not the most polished framework you'll encounter. It's quick and perhaps a bit rough around the edges. Yet, it adheres to certain standards and, most importantly, it works.

This repository is a testament to a collaborative journey, a blend of creativity and technology, and a reflection of the art of archiving.

## What Does It Take?

To use this framework effectively, you'll need the following:

1. **Web Space**: Access to web hosting space where your portfolio site will be hosted.

2. **Database**: The ability to create and manage a MySQL database for storing your portfolio content.

3. **PHP (Version 7+)**: Ensure that your hosting environment supports PHP, preferably version 7 or higher. PHP is essential for the dynamic functionality of your portfolio.

4. **Web Development Skills**: While not mandatory, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and PHP can be very helpful. This knowledge allows you to customize and tailor your portfolio to your artistic vision.

5. **Browser Familiarity**: Comfort with using web browsers to open deep links and navigate your portfolio. This skill will make it easier to explore and share your work.
